The sofa is located at (153.0, 78.1). \n\nTo find the relative direction of the sofa from the stove, I will calculate the angle between the stove and the sofa. The angle can be found using the arctangent function (atan2) of the difference in y-coordinates and x-coordinates. \n\nThe difference in y-coordinates is 123.2 - 78.1 = 45.1. \nThe difference in x-coordinates is 153.0 - (-235.6) = 388.6. \n\nNow, I will calculate the angle using atan2:\n\nangle = atan2(45.1, 388.6) ≈ 0.12 radians (7 degrees)\n\nSince the angle is less than 45 degrees, the sofa is to the right of the stove when facing the TV. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. right.", "obj2d_path": "/root/TIS/ARKitScenes/raw_annotation/41069025_3dod_annotation.json", "obj2d_in_prompt": true}

To determine the direction of the sofa, I need to calculate the angle between the washer and the sofa, and the angle between the refrigerator and the sofa.\n\nFirst, I calculate the angle between the washer and the sofa:\n- The washer is to the right of the sofa.\n- The angle between the washer and the sofa is approximately 135 degrees (since the washer is to the right of the sofa and the sofa is to the left of the washer).\n\nNext, I calculate the angle between the refrigerator and the sofa:\n- The refrigerator is to the left of the sofa.\n- The angle between the refrigerator and the sofa is approximately 135 degrees (since the refrigerator is to the left of the sofa and the sofa is to the right of the refrigerator).\n\nSince both angles are approximately 135 degrees, the sofa is directly opposite the washer and the refrigerator. Therefore, the sofa is to the back.\n\nAnswer: B. back", "obj2d_path": "/root/TIS/ARKitScenes/raw_annotation/42897528_3dod_annotation.json", "obj2d_in_prompt": true}
