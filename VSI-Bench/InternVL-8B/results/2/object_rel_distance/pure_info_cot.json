A. chair: The closest point of the chair is [-263.5, 105.2]. The distance between the fireplace and the chair is sqrt((119.2 - (-263.5))^2 + (123.3 - 105.2)^2) = sqrt((382.7)^2 + (18.1)^2) = sqrt(146445.29 + 324.61) = sqrt(146769.9) ≈ 384.8 cm.

A. table: sqrt((487.5 - (-74.4))^2 + (70.1 - 133.1)^2) = sqrt((561.9)^2 + (-63)^2) = sqrt(314525.61 + 3969) = sqrt(318514.61) = 567.8 B. fireplace: sqrt((526.6 - (-74.4))^2 + (91.3 - 133.1)^2) = sqrt((601)^2 + (-41.8)^2) = sqrt(361201 + 1728.64) = sqrt(362929.64) = 602.9 C. sofa: sqrt((356.0 - (-74.4))^2 + (93.6 - 133.1)^2) = sqrt((430.4)^2 + (-39.5)^2) = sqrt(184816.16 + 1550.25) = sqrt(186366.41) = 430.8 D. tv: sqrt((453.2 - (-74.4))^2 + (114.3 - 133.1)^2) = sqrt((527.6)^2 + (-18.8)^2) = sqrt(277577.76 + 351.04) = sqrt(277928.8) = 527.9 The closest object to the stove is the table, with a distance of 567.8 centimeters.

    "raw_response": "To find the closest object to the refrigerator, I need to compare the distances of the stool, washer, table, and tv from the refrigerator. The coordinates of the refrigerator are [46.9, 108.5]. I will calculate the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of each object and the coordinates of the refrigerator. The Euclidean distance formula is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\n1. Stool: The closest point of the stool is [-229.2, 32.7]. The distance is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((-229.2 - 46.9)^2 + (32.7 - 108.5)^2) = sqrt((-276.1)^2 + (-75.8)^2) = sqrt(76,269.61 + 5,764.64) = sqrt(13,293.25) ≈ 116.1 cm\n\n2. Washer: The closest point of the washer is [-277.6, 61.3]. The distance is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((-277.6 - 46.9)^2 + (61.3 - 108.5)^2) = sqrt((-324.5)^2 + (-47.2)^2) = sqrt(105,962.25 + 2,229.44) = sqrt(108,191.69) ≈ 104.8 cm\n\n3. Table: The closest point of the table is [264.3, 64.3]. The distance is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((264.3 - 46.9)^2 + (64.3 - 108.5)^2) = sqrt((217.4)^2 + (-44.2)^2) = sqrt(47,252.36 + 1,947.64) = sqrt(2,399.00) ≈ 48.6 cm\n\n4. Tv: The closest point of the tv is [161.2, 135.4]. The distance is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((161.2 - 46.9)^2 + (135.4 - 108.5)^2) = sqrt((114.3)^2 + (26.9)^2) = sqrt(12,998.49 + 722.61) = sqrt(13,721.10) ≈ 116.8 cm\n\nComparing the distances, the table is the closest to the refrigerator with a distance of approximately 48.6 cm.

The Euclidean distance formula is:\n\ndistance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n\nFor the table, the coordinates are [22.2, 47.9], so the distance is sqrt((137.2 - 22.2)^2 + (78.1 - 47.9)^2) = sqrt(115^2 + 30.2^2) = sqrt(13225 + 906.04) = sqrt(14131.04) ≈ 119.5 cm. For the stove, the coordinates are [6.3, 108.4], so the distance is sqrt((137.2 - 6.3)^2 + (78.1 - 108.4)^2) = sqrt(130.9^2 + 30.3^2) = sqrt(16996.81 + 912.09) = sqrt(17908.9) ≈ 133.3 cm. For the tv, the coordinates are [-85.2, 118.6], so the distance is sqrt((137.2 - (-85.2))^2 + (78.1 - 118.6)^2) = sqrt(222.4^2 + 40.5^2) = sqrt(49308.76 + 1640.25) = sqrt(50948.01) ≈ 226.1 cm. For the stool, the coordinates are [-28.7, 45.8], so the distance is sqrt((137.2 - (-28.7))^2 + (78.1 - 45.8)^2) = sqrt(165.9^2 + 32.3^2) = sqrt(27456.81 + 1042.89) = sqrt(28499.7) ≈ 168.8 cm.

The distance between the stool and the stove is:\n\ndistance_stove = sqrt((-51.8 - 140.4)^2 + (32.8 - 102.8)^2) = sqrt((-192.2)^2 + (-70)^2) = sqrt(36824.4 + 4900) = sqrt(41724.4) ≈ 204.1 cm\n\nFor the chair, the coordinates are [57.7, 69.7]. The distance between the stool and the chair is:\n\ndistance_chair = sqrt((-51.8 - 57.7)^2 + (32.8 - 69.7)^2) = sqrt((-109.5)^2 + (-36.9)^2) = sqrt(11890.25 + 1360.81) = sqrt(13251.06) ≈ 114.8 cm\n\nFor the tv, the coordinates are [-332.9, 138.6].
